# Builds

**Linaro Build:** Created and maintained by the SoC vendor with help from Linaro. Linaro builds are focused on hardware enablement and are intended to maximize features and functionality of a particular SoC. Linaro or Community builds are usually provided as the stock image of a board when purchased.

**Community Build:** Created and maintained by the community and SoC vendor. Like member builds, these builds are also focused on hardware enablement and intended to maximize features and functionality of a particular SoC. Member or Community builds are usually provided as the stock image of a board when purchased.

**Reference Platform Build:** Created and maintained by Linaro, this build's goal is to deliver Linaro output for ARM SoCs using the 96Boards Specification. Releases may contain bootloader, kernel, distribution and/or user level middleware/applications. Reference Platform Builds are intended to be fully functional, though lacking the complete enablement of features you might find in Member and Vendor builds. Linaro engineering efforts are focused on bringing these builds to the latest possible kernel. An effort to unify the kernel and bootloader for all certified 96Boards is also and RPB priority. With commitment to upstream support, these builds are an ideal starting point for new ARM SoC boards.
