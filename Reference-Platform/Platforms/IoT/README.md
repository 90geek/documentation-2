# IoT Reference Platforms - Documentation

The IoT reference platformâ€™s goal is to provide an end to end open source secure pipeline from gateway devices to endpoints.  For the deeply embedded use cases, a Zephyr RTOS baseline is provided to enable a series of hardware platforms, which ships with a rich developer SDK. The gateway is a variant of the Consumer reference platform based on Debian, leveraging the latest in cloud and container technology. Secure updates are not a mere afterthought, instead this software stack has been designed with security and maintainability in mind from day one.

## Features
 - Zephyr RTOS with SDK for endpoints
 - Open Boot Firmware for endpoints
 - Debian builds for gateways
 - Secure update pipeline for all devices
